As observed in Figure 8, picoeukaryotes concentration is stable after summer 2022 whereas nanoeukaryotic cell count increased drastically in autumn 2022.\nIn Figure 9 we observe the minimum at Peña la Vieja during late winter 2022. At El Confital 1, Synechoccocus count fell to a minimum while Prochlorococcus remained at middle values.\nFigure 10 shows a decoupling between the otherwise highly correlated concentrations of both genuses.\nWhen seasonal variation is considered (Figure 11), we registered minimum values in spring 2022 for HNA. Contrarily, the minimum for LNA happened before, in autumn 2022. This inverse correlation between HNA and LNA can be better observed in Figure 12. There is an evident opposing tendency between HNA and LNA cells due to their reproductive strategies. It has been proposed by Santos et al. (2019) that HNA bacteria flourish during fecal contamination events. This could be the case at hand during summer 2022, when we observed maximum values for HNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Eukaryotic cells temporal distribution.

The TOC maximum of Peña la Vieja also stands out. Moving to figure Figure 5 we observe that it was measured at the end of the monitoring period in the spring of 2023. On the other hand, TON dropped in El Confital 1 and Peña la Vieja between October 2022 and April 2023. This is not the case at Hotel Cristina. Further investigation is needed in order to understand the factors driving these processes.\nIn both Figure 4 and Figure 6, we can observe a difference between El Confital and Las Canteras. Concretely, Si(OH)₄ and NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ concentration are overall higher in Las Canteras compared to El Confital. Within Las Canteras, these nutrients show a decreasing tendency as we move North. This pattern is representative of different land input regimes, whose shaping agents are the ravines located South of Las Canteras. Ravine discharge contains siliceous sediments from volcanic rocks as well as nitrtates. However, in Figure 4 shows an unusual distribution of NO₃⁻ + NO₂⁻ at Peña la Vieja, which could be an indicator of anthropogenic input of nutrients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Organic nutrient distribution across sampling stations.

This is not exactly the case. As you can observe in Figure 1, lowest annual SST is recorded in March, which also marks the arrival of the spring. The highest temperature, on the contrary, is measured in October, for us commonly associated with the beginning of the autumn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sea surface temperature variations across the year.",

We can easily calculate de probability of encountering each ASV by diving the number of encounters by the total number of repetitions.

Relative abundance is preferred over reads because not all samples contained the same number of total ASV reads (Figure 3). This inconsistency can be misleading when comparing data from different samples Gloor et al. (2017). Relative abundance is easily computed by dividing the number of reads of a certain taxon by the total ASV reads within the sample. Figure 5 shows that, overall, rarer taxa are less abundant. Note that, as stated above, there are far more data points in singular and recurring categories than in the ubiquitous category. Longer right tails in infrequent ASV distribution indicate exceptional cases where rare taxa become predominant in the sample.

    "text": "Enterococcus is a genus of bacteria widely used as an indicator of fecal contamination. Standard biochemical tests and culturing methods are used to establish the amount of colony forming units (CFU) for an amount of sampled volume of water. Public regulations define threshold values for enterococci concentration to assets water quality, and many bathing zones are closed because they don’t meet hygienic criteria. In a review study, Peter, Bertone, and Stewart (2025) claimed that sewage discharge from human and animal wastewaters is the primary source of enterococci. They also proposed heavy rainfall and storms as key drivers of acute contamination events in coastal waters.",

A research project of marine microbial indicators of biological contamination in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain. This project is made in association with [Biological Oceanography in a Changing Ocean - IOCAG](https://www.gob-iocag.ulpgc.es/) and their team from the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.\n\nThe database of the project was made possible by Markel Gómez Letona^[<https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9325-3979>], Maria Fernanda Montero^[<https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8124-8136>] and Javier Arístegui^[<https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7526-7741>].\n\n## The monitoring program\n\nThe microbiome monitoring consists of 47 samples. As shown in @fig-samples-map, these were collected in five different locations across Las Canteras and El Confital. The monitoring period spanned for 2 years, it began in July 2021 and ended in April 2023, with a sampling frequency of around 1 month.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",

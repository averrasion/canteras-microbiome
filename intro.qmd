The microbiome monitoring consists of 47 samples collected at 5 locations across Las Canteras and El Confital. The monitoring of environmental parameters including cytometry compromised a larger frame, with 8 locations (@fig-map). Microbiome monitoring spanned for 2 years, it began in July 2021 and ended in April 2023, with a sampling frequency of around 1 month. Environmental parameters began their sampling in April 2020, coinciding with lock down of economic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic (@fig-samples).
